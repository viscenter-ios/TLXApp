        <h2>There was a bug in the last build, which was using Xcode 4 beta and iOS 5 beta 3.</h2>
            <p>This app was originally based on a <a href="http://halsted.vis.uky.edu/~justin/qWebApp/trunk/start.php">web application</a></p>
            <p>The Task Load Index was created by NASA and is a very popular way to measure task load.  The app uses the NASA-TLX survey (saved as a .txt file), but is also capable of creating custom questionnaires.</p>
